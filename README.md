## Project Decsription
For this project, I downloaded data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and created an SQLite database to store and query it using [this script](https://github.com/jenn-db/Covid-19-SQL-Tableau/blob/main/COVID-19%20SQL.sql). I then extracted the tables to Tableau Desktop to create my dashboard: [Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/QXJC2BD9M?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
