# COVID-19 Data Exploration

For this project, I downloaded data from Our World in Data and created an SQLite database (script available in the repository) to store and query it. I then extracted the tables to Tableau Desktop to create my dashboard: [Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/QXJC2BD9M?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
