## Project Decsription
For this project, I downloaded data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and created an SQLite database to store it, and wrote [an SQL script](https://github.com/jenn-db/Covid-19-SQL-Tableau/blob/main/COVID-19%20SQL.sql) to query the data. I then extracted the tables to Tableau Desktop and created my dashboard: [Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/QXJC2BD9M?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

 * Monthly New Covid Cases
